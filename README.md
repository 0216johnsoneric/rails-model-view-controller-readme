# Rails Model View Controller 

## Objectives

- Define the responsibilities of models, views, and controllers in web applications
- Describe where MVC goes in a Rails application structure
- Follow an http request from browser to router to controller to model to view to response to browser


## Notes

Use a kitchen metaphor to describe MVC: 
Model is the chef
Controller is the waiter
View is the table (or the saucier if you will, the person that does the plating)

Introduce the concept of Model View Controller from a rails perspective.

Diagram a request flow, from browser, to http request, to router, to controller, to model, to view, to controller, to http response, to browser.

Describe the responsibilities of the different kinds of code you write, what goes where, data code, model logic, controller rendering/redirect logic, view / presentation logic, routing, even actionview helpers. A quick example would be helpful.
